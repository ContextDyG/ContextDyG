## ContextDyG: A Dynamic Graph Learning Method with Contextual Interaction Frequency Encoding

### Abstract
Dynamic graph learning has broad applications in fields such as social media analysis and recommendation systems. When addressing these issues, conventional static graph models often fail to capture the continuously evolving graph structural relationships, making the study of dynamic graphs critically important. With the advancement of dynamic graph representation learning, the industry trend has been to continuously enrich temporal and frequency domain information between nodes to improve model performance. However, existing methods struggle to precisely capture the complex dynamics of interactions within node neighborhoods and fail to fully reveal the deep semantics and evolutionary patterns of neighborhood structures. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, ContextDyG. It introduces an innovative Contextual Interaction Frequency (CIF) encoding module. The core idea is to construct a multi-dimensional raw feature vector to characterize the contextual importance of each neighboring node. These features are then analyzed in the frequency domain using learnable frequency-domain filters. CIF can uncover latent periodicity, trends, and critical ``shift" signals in neighbor interaction sequences at a higher level of abstraction. We conduct experiments on six real-world datasets and compare ContextDyG with previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The experiments show that ContextDyG significantly outperforms all baseline models, achieving new SOTA.
